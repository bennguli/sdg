    <h1><b><strong>Reducing the proportion of men, women and children living in poverty by half.</strong></b></h1> To alleviate the population from indiscriminate poverty,creation of jobs will strengthen our economies and subsequently bring about reduction of the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions by half.

    <i>By taking the following into account,our common goals can be achieved.</i>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Employers are a heterogeneous group with diverse needs, goals, and preferences. </b>
    <br/>
    <p>Many employers do already partner with school-to-work initiatives and “second-chance” programs for young adults who are neither working nor in school. The research evidence on what motivates them to do so or to hire disadvantaged young people is limited, but it appears that their motivations vary. A few studies have pointed to a sense of social responsibility and philanthropy as the primary motivating factors, but others say that public recognition matters as well. Forum attendees agreed that these angles have the potential to gain the attention of some employers, especially if they see their peers and competitors leading the way.</p>
    <br/>
    <b>Employers may respond to financial incentives, but incentives are not likely to be the only force motivating their decisions, and wage subsidies have actually been shown to stigmatize groups of workers.</b>
    <br/>
    <p>Forum experts challenged the notion that employers make individual hiring decisions solely based on the proverbial “bottom line,” citing complex and evolving recruiting processes that vary widely by employer and industry. However, the group did believe that financial incentives like tax credits and wage subsidies could get some employers more involved in youth employment. Attendees mentioned in particular a tax credit used to expand apprenticeship programs in South Carolina and the federal Work Opportunities Tax Credit available to employers for hiring individuals with certain barriers to employment. The group also acknowledged that prior research suggests highly targeted financial subsidies may actually stigmatize the workers they target. Employers may not respond positively to financial incentives if they do not believe that young workers will make good hires, and many employers are likely to have a dim view of young workers’ skills, experience, and work ethic.</p>
    <br/>
    <b>Employers are more likely to engage in youth employment efforts if it is easy for them to do so and if they believe it is a positive opportunity for their businesses.</b>
    <br/>
    <p>The experts agreed that any effort to engage employers in hiring more young people should include a marketing component to change the way many employers have come to view young workers, educate them about the potential of a young and diverse workforce, and debunk myths about young workers that may be based in stereotypes. Attendees also underscored the importance of “keeping it easy” for employers when encouraging them to engage in any youth workforce initiatives. Technical assistance providers and workforce intermediaries can contribute to that goal.</p>
    <b>Employers’ growing use of third parties to recruit and screen new employees has significant implications for efforts to increase the hiring of disadvantaged young adults. </b>
    <br/>
    <p>While employers’ use of staffing or temporary placement agencies to meet short-term labor needs is not a new practice, more and more employers are relying on such contingency staffing agencies to increase workforce flexibility and reduce recruitment and screening costs.[1] Experts at the forum also spoke about the growing trend toward “recruitment process outsourcing,” where many employers are transferring all or part of the recruitment process to an external service provider. Since these third-party actors serve as the first line of contact between many employers and job seekers, they may play a key role in any efforts to improve labor-market outcomes for disadvantaged young adults. It is important to understand how they interact (or do not interact) with young job seekers — for example, where they look for candidates and how they select candidates for entry-level positions.</p>
    <br/>


    <b>Widespread adoption of computerized applicant tracking systems has also changed the way employers interact with job seekers.</b>
    <br/>
    <p>These systems function most simply as databases in which firms can manage their recruitment efforts and applicant information, but many also perform screening functions (for example, by searching résumés for key words or years of experience). The effects of computerized hiring mechanisms are not yet fully understood, especially for disadvantaged job seekers. On one hand, forum experts pointed out that computerized screening could potentially decrease the effects of discrimination and stigma by removing human bias and subjectivity. However, these automated systems are still likely to reflect the values of the employers and the recruiters who design them, and more importantly, the ability of these systems to match candidates to jobs depends on how well they are designed.</p>
