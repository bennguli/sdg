    <h1><b><strong>poverty economic agenda 2030</strong></b></h1>
    <b></b>
    <p>
        Economies must be put at the service of people, through effective integrated social policies, the United Nations Secretary-General told the Commission for Social Development today, stressing that, in a world where inequality was still too high and too few economies had attained sustainable growth, the body’s policy guidance would be critical to global efforts to end poverty by 2030.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Your work will be crucial for ensuring that the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals truly leave no one behind,” Ban Ki-moon said, as he opened week two of the Commission’s fifty-fourth session. Too many people continued to face exclusion and people were frustrated at “working harder” while “falling behind”.
    </p>
    <p>
        For its part, he said the United Nations was ready to help States achieve goals and work closely with civil society to give life to a shared vision. He had recently submitted his report to the General Assembly on the milestones towards the follow-up to the 2030 Agenda, which, among other things, reflected on how the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development could instil coherence in the work of all intergovernmental platforms in the system and derive political guidance from their conclusions.

        Throughout the day, representatives of Governments, non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies alike offered prescriptions, in two separate debates, for creating more just, inclusive and equal societies. In the first, speakers concluded discussion of the priority theme, “rethinking and strengthening social development in the contemporary world”, outlining national efforts to create jobs, improve education and health-care systems and, more broadly, harmonize domestic laws with international standards. Several highlighted collaborations with United Nations agencies.

        In that context, El Salvador’s representative said her Government used a multidimensional measurement of poverty that included well-being, education, employment, housing and basic services, allowing the Government to target geographic locations or populations affected by more extreme poverty. Mongolia’s delegate noted that his Government had opened youth development centres in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), providing skills training, counselling and support group activities.

        Still others had recommendations for the Commission, with Belgium’s representative, on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, suggesting the Commission integrate the 2030 Agenda into its work, in coordination with — rather than excluded from — other Council subsidiary bodies and the Council itself. Algeria’s representative added that aid should respect Monterrey Consensus commitments for debt relief, productive investment and global economic governance.

        In the second debate, speakers continued discussion under the theme “review of relevant United Nations plans and programmes of action pertaining to the situation of social groups”, with representatives of United Nations agencies outlining success and challenges in improving social indicators.

        The Chief of the Social Integration Section in the Social Development Division of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said that together with the International Labour Organization (ILO), it had drafted the first-of-its-kind regional situational report, “Switched On: Youth at the Heart of Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific”, to examine the 2030 Agenda from a youth perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Africa, said the Director of the Social Policy Division of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the main challenge was to unlock the continent’s resource potential through suitable macroeconomic and social policies that would lead to sustained high economic growth.

        Also speaking in the debates today were representatives of Cameroon, Belarus, Kazakhstan, India, Italy, Iran, Senegal, Algeria, Japan, Germany, Ecuador, Pakistan, Qatar, Botswana, Sweden, Kenya, Nepal, Costa Rica, United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Maldives, Republic of Moldova, Morocco, Namibia, Cuba, Benin, Libya, Rwanda and Colombia, as well as the Holy See and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
        Representatives of the following organizations also spoke: Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Partners in Population and Development, International Council on Social Welfare, International Federation for Family Development, International Federation for Family Development, AARP and the Latin American Human Rights Centre, as did representatives of International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).

        Daniela Bas, Director of the Division for Social Policy and Development of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, introduced conference room paper E/CN.5/2016/CRP.1.
    </p>

        The Commission will reconvene at 10:00 a.m. Friday, 12 February, to conclude its fifty-fourth session.

        <u>Opening Remarks</u>

        BAN KI-MOON, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the Commission’s work affected 1.2 billion young people, more than 900 million older persons and 1 billion persons with disabilities around the world. “Your work will be crucial in ensuring that the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals truly leave no one behind,” he declared. “Economies must be put at the service of people, through effective integrated social policies.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, he said, the Commission had shed light on the role of proactive social policies in securing economic and environmental stability, with “enormous” progress in lifting people out of extreme poverty, boosting food security, advancing universal primary education, promoting women’s empowerment and reducing maternal and child mortality. The full inclusion of persons with disabilities had critical importance in ensuring social protection for all.
    </p>
    <p>
        In today’s world, he said, too many people continued to face exclusion, too few economies had attained inclusive and sustainable growth and people were frustrated at “working harder” while “falling behind”. Many wondered whether world leaders were listening. Through the 2030 Agenda, “we will end global poverty by 2030”, he said, and build a life of dignity for all on a healthy planet. The United Nations was ready to help States to achieve goals and work closely with civil society to give life to a shared vision.
    </p>
    <p>
        He had recently submitted his report to the General Assembly on the milestones extending towards the coherent and inclusive follow up to the 2030 Agenda, he said, which reflected on how the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development could rally international intergovernmental platforms within the United Nations, aiming to clarify the roles of the Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and other forums. In such an endeavour, the Commission’s work would be critical.
    </p>

        ION JINGA (<u>Romania</u>), Chair of the Commission for Social Development, said that since its inception, it had supported Government structures and policy environments to help countries to meet their full potential. It had called for countries to take steps for “shared prosperity for all” and had pushed for coherent action in social, economic, environment and political spheres aimed at poverty eradication, decent work for all and social integration, based on the respect for human rights. In its deliberations last week, the Commission had done its best to promote 2016 as a year for national traction towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and people-centred development. The Commission had taken stock of major developments in the regions and globally, but noted that poverty remained the greatest challenge of modern times. The Commission had also expressed its deep preoccupation with the negative impact of conflict and violent extremism on social development.
